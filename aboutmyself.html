Hello fellow person!

My name is Disable Graphics and I'm a computer lover. I have been interested in programming since I was 12. <br> <br>

To be honest, i'm not the best developer out there, so maybe some of my projects are kinda weird to use. <br>
Most of them are front-ends of another program to make it easier to use, since i'm so ~~lazy~~ good person. <br>

I really like free software, so every project I have made is licensed under the GNU GPL (excepting one which was under the LGPL) <br>

Feel free to look around, since some of my projects might be interesting for your needs. <br>
<h3>MY HARDWARE</h3>
I currently own a laptop with triple boot (Manjaro GNU/Linux MATE, Android x86 & GhostBSD), another laptop, this with lower specs (Void GNU/Linux),
 a Raspberry Pi 2B (Revision 1.1) with RetroPie, and, finally, an ODROID GO game console (ESP32-based).
