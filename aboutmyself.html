<h3>ABOUT </h3> <br>
Hello fellow person!

My name is Disable Graphics and I'm a computer lover. I have been interested in programming since I was 12. <br> <br>

To be honest, i'm not the best developer out there, so maybe some of my projects are kinda weird to use. <br>
Most of them are front-ends of another program to make it easier to use, since i'm very lazy. <br> <br>

I really like free software, so every project I have made is licensed under the GNU GPL (excepting one which was under the LGPL) <br> <br>

Feel free to look around, since some of my projects might be interesting for you. <br> <br>

<h3> WARNING </h3> <br>
I'm not a native English speaker, in fact, my English is very bad.
