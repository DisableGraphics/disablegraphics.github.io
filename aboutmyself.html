Hello fellow person!

My name is Disable Graphics and I'm a computer lover. I have been interested in programming since I was 12.

To be honest, i'm not the best developer out there, so maybe some of my projects are kinda weird to use. 
Most of them are front-ends of another program to make it easier to use, since i'm so ~~lazy~~ good person.

I really like free software, so every project I have made is licensed under the GNU GPL (excepting one which was under the LGPL)

Feel free to look around, since some of my projects might be interesting for your needs.
# MY HARDWARE
I currently own a laptop with triple boot (Manjaro GNU/Linux MATE, Android x86 & GhostBSD), another laptop, this with lower specs (Void GNU/Linux),
 a Raspberry Pi 2B (Revision 1.1) with RetroPie, and, finally, an ODROID GO game console (ESP32-based).
