# ABOUT
Hello fellow person!

My name is Disable Graphics and I'm a computer lover. I have been interested in programming since I was 12.

Feel free to look around, since some of my projects might be interesting.
# MY HARDWARE
I currently own a laptop with triple boot (Ubuntu MATE, PrimeOS (android-x86 based) & GhostBSD), another laptop, this with lower specs (Bodhi Linux & ReactOS),
 a Raspberry Pi 2B (Revision 1.1) with Rasbian & RetroPie, and, finally, an ODROID GO game console (ESP32-based).
